To modify the consonants default pronunciation, use the lower case vowel after the consonant.
For example, the word **ako** is going to be typed as `Ako` where the consonant Ka is followed by lower case o to form Ko.

For consonants without vowels on the end, use **/** to mark as such.
For example, the word **tabon** is going to be typed as `tbon/`
