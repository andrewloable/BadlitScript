# Display Badlit Script on Facebook using Google Chrome on Windows

There is currently a bug with Google Chrome that only shows boxes for the Badlit/Baybayin fonts when using Facebook.
This bug does not show up if you are using Firefox.

To display the script, you have to install a modified Arial font that contains the Badlit Script to display them properly.

# Instructions

First, download the Arial.ttf file then double click on it to install.
Once installed, Badlit Script should show up on facebook instead of boxes.
